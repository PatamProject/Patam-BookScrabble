*This file is used to track the connection protocol with the server and which methods are used for each call*

How is the protocol built: 'id':'senderName'&'commandName':'arg1','arg2','arg3'... (args1 = sender)
We send a string between the host and the server, the string is seperated by '&' 
The first part is the name of the sender and ID, the second part is called the 'body'.
The Host will receive the message, split the message by '&', add the name of the sender to the list of players 
and pass the rest of the message to the HostSideHandler class.

Client to host Protocol: 
format = ('id':'senderName'&'commandName':'arg1','arg2','arg3'...)
Types of commands and their arguments if exist: 
"'id':'name'&join'" - Player wants to join the game
"'id':'name'&leave'" - Player wants to leave the game
"'id':'name'&'skipTurn'" - Player wants to skip his turn without placing a word
"'id':'name'&'Q':'word,row,col,isVertical'" - Player wants to place a word
"'id':'name'&'C'" - Player wants to challenge a failed word placement 
"'id':'name'&'startGame'" - Host wants to start the game

Host to client protocol: The host can either reply to a specific client or send a game update ("!") to all clients 

Types of responses and their arguments:
"join:'id',pName1, pName2 ...." - Seccessfully joined a game - ID given for future identification and a list of players in the game

"C:'score','tiles','nextPlayer'" - Challenge was received, score == 0 -> not boardLegal, score == -1 -> not dictionaryLegal, else score and tiles are sent
