*This file is used to track the connection protocol with the server and which methods
are used for each call*

How is the protocol built:
We send a string between the host and the server, the string is seperated by '&' 
The first part is the name of the sender and the second part is called the 'body'.
The Host will receive the message, split the message by '&', add the name of the sender to the list of players 
and pass the rest of the message to the GameHandler class.

Client to host protocol:
Body:
The message itself. The body is split by ',' and each part is called an argument.
Arguments are read in the ----- ........
Types of arguments: (Return values are in brackets)
"0" - Tell host you are disconnecting from the host. (void)
"1" - Ask host to join a game. If accepted host will return info about the game (Under Host to client protocol)
"2,word-row-col-isVertical" - Client wants to play a word on the board. (String) (Returns the score of the word and the tiles to take)
"3" - Skip turn. Returns a random tile from the bag. (String)
"Q,'word'" - Quary 'word' in the dictionary. (True/False)
"C,'word'" - Challenge 'word' in the dictionary. (True/False)

How each request is handled:
Client()--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->--->Host()
"0"--->Disconnect--->
"1"--->Join Game--->
"2"--->Play Word--->
"3"--->Skip Turn--->
"Q"--->Quary--->
"C"--->Challenge--->

Host to client protocol:
"0" - Host rejected the connection.
"1,'name1','name2',name3'" - Host accepted the connection. All players in the game are listed.
"2,score" - Host accepted the word and returns the score of the word. (If the score is 0 the word was not accpeted)
"3,'tile'" - Host returns the tile to the player. (If the tile is 0 the bag is empty)
"G" - Updates from the host regarding game state to ALL players:
    - "S,'name1-tiles','name2-tiles','name3-tiles'" - Game started. Handed tiles to each player by play order.
    - "P,N,'name'" : New player joined the game.
    - "P,L,'name'" : Player left the game.
    - "P,S,'score','tiles'" : Player score was updated to 'score' and took 'tiles' from bag. Next turn by play order.
    - "N,'tile'" - Player didn't place a word and took 'tile' from bag. Next turn by play order. 
    - "E,'name'" - Game ended. 'name' won the game.
"C,True/False,'score','tiles'" - Host returns the result of the challenge. (True/False) Score and tiles are sent if true.
"Q,True/False,'score','tiles'" - Host returns the result of the quary. (True/False) Score and tiles are sent if true.
"E,'name'" - Game Ended! Returns the winner of the game. (String)

How each request is handled:
