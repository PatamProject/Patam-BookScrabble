*This file is used to track the connection protocol with the server and which methods
are used for each call*

How is the protocol built:
We send a string between the host and the server, the string is seperated by ","
The first char of the string is used to determine the type of traffic being passed.

What kind of traffic types exist:
"1" - Traffic related to client-server communications
    - ""

"2" - Traffic related to GameHandler such as creating and manipulating objects 
    - "G,N" : Create new Game objects (void)
    - "G,S" : Start the game and creates a Rack object to all players and sends
              the tiles taken for each player. (String)
    Related to Player objects:
        - "P,N,'name'" : New Player object with name 'name'. (void)
        - "P,S,'name'" : Returns the score player 'name'. (String)
        - "P,T,'name'" : Returns the tiles of the player 'name' (String)
        - "P,W,'name','string'" : Player 'name' tries to play the word 'string' on board (String)
        - "P,L,'name'" : Player 'name' has left the game/disconnected. (void)
    Related to Tile objects:
        - "T,'name'" : Player 'name' takes a tile from bag (String)    

"3" - Traffic related to BookScrabbleHandler for quary and challenge

for example:
"3,Q,banana" ---> "3" means BookScrabbleHandler, "Q" means quary() function to check the word
in the DictionaryManager and "banana" is the word itself.
