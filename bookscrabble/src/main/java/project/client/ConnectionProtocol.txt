*This file is used to track the connection protocol with the server and which methods
are used for each call*

How is the protocol built: 'sender'&'commandName':'arg1','arg2','arg3'... (args1 = sender)
We send a string between the host and the server, the string is seperated by '&' 
The first part is the name of the sender and the second part is called the 'body'.
The Host will receive the message, split the message by '&', add the name of the sender to the list of players 
and pass the rest of the message to the ------- class.

Client to host Protocol:
If the message contains "&" it is a game update message, else it is a response to a request.
The message itself. The body is split by ':' to two parts, the command and the arguments for the command.
Arguments are read in the ----- ........ //example : "'senderName'&'takeTile':'Y'"
Types of commands and their arguments if exist: 
"'name'&join'" - Player wants to join the game - connectedClients.add(name,socket) + game.addNewPlayer(name)
"'name'&leave'" - Player wants to leave the game - connectedClients.remove(name) + game.removePlayer(name)
"'name'&'skipTurn'" - Player wants to skip his turn - 
"'name'&'Q':'word,row,col,isVertical'" - Player wants to place a word, uses query  -
"'name'&'C':'word,row,col,isVertical'" - Player wants to place a word, uses challenge  

Types of responses and their arguments:
"join:true" - Seccessfully joined a game


Host to client protocol:
The body is split by ':' to two parts, the commandName and return value of the command to the client.
Arguments are read in the ----- ........ //example : "'senderName'&'commandName':'Y'"
The original sender of the message is will receive the message below, the rest will split the message by '&' to get to name of the sender that will be added as the first argument.
Types of commands and their return values: (Errors are handled by the client)

"join:true" / Error - Joined a game
"Q:'score'" - Tried to place a word, if score is positive the word is valid and score is added, if 0/-1 the word is invalid due to boardLegal or dictionaryLegal

"!join:'name'" - A player joined the game
"!leave:'name'" - A player left the game
"!Q:'name','score'" - Player placed a word seccessfully and got 'score' points (Player will add up back to 7 tiles)
